# JaphethOruko's Portfolio

---
Japheth Oruko Portfolio is a personal showcase of my work across business development, product management, UI/UX design, and frontend engineering. This repository serves as both a technical and creative portfolio, reflecting my ability to bridge strategy, design, and implementation.

Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, ESLint, and Prettier to ensure a scalable, maintainable, and modern development setup.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses
[`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)
to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font
family for Vercel.
